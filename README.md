## ⭐Weather App || Ayush Ojha ⭐


⭕This Weather App is designed to provide users with real-time weather information based on their location or by searching for a specific city. The app features a clean, tab-based interface that allows users to switch effortlessly between "Your Weather" (location-based) and "Search Weather" (city-based) views. Key functionalities include displaying temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness, all sourced from the OpenWeather API.

💻 Personal Touches & Improvements:

⭐ Error Handling: I added a functionality to show a "City not found" message if the searched city isn't available, ensuring users never see blank or incorrect data.<br>
⭐ Seamless Tab Switching: Fixed an issue where switching tabs sometimes resulted in blank data. Now, the app maintains separate data states for each tab, guaranteeing the correct weather data is always displayed without the need to reload the page.
